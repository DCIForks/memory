# Task for Step 02: Create styling for the card back
*(See CHANGELOG.md) for details of how Step 01 was treated.)*

Display two cards side-by-side, or one beneath the other, depending on the aspect-ratio of the browser window. The first card should be the one you created in step 01. The second should show the back of the card.

1. Display two Card components, both with a "card" className and with the üçí emoji character as a prop.
2. The first component should receive a `turned` prop with a value of `true` and be shown face-up, as before
3. The second component should receive a `turned` prop with a value of `false` and it should show the back of the card.
4. Give the card back a gradient, and the same border as the front.
5. Do not show the üçí image on the face-down card.
6. As before, put all your CSS inside `styles.css`.
7. If the page is in portrait mode, show the cards one above the other; if it is in landscape mode, show them side-by-side.

You can see a demo of the expected result [here](https://dciforks.github.io/memory/step/02). Do your best to match the styling as closely as possible. You will use the suggested styling as the starting point for the next step.

# Task for Step 01: Create a single styled card, face up

You can start by creating a square card with an image of two cherries, using the Unicode emoji character üçí. 

1. Create a Card component and send it the üçí emoji character as a prop.
2. Give the Card component a "card" className.
3. Put all your CSS inside `styles.css`.
4. Centre the image.
5. Give the card a neutral background and a border.
6. Give the card rounded corners

Emoji characters can scale to any size, so make the card fill the viewport, then alter the size of the viewport to check that the card, the border and the image all scale proportionately.

You can see a demo of the expected result [here](https://dciforks.github.io/memory/step/01). Do your best to match the styling as closely as possible. You will use the suggested styling as the starting point for the next step.


# Building a Memory game in React

This repo contains a multi-step assignment that guides you as you build a Memory game using React.

The branches are named step01, step02 and so on. Each branch contains a README.md (like this one) with a simple task for you to complete. The next branch in numerical order contains a solution for the previous task, plus a new task.

You can find a demo of the completed game [here](https://dciforks.github.io/memory). You can use the hamburger menu on this page to see side-by-side each of the tasks and the expected result of that completed task.‚óä

Here's an overview of the steps:

1. Create a single styled card, face up
2. Create the styling for the back of the card
3. Use CSS classes to flip the card
4. Create a responsive layout of multiple cards

6. Detect matching pairs of cards
7. Use custom images
8. Select the number of pairs to use for a game
9. Allow players to enter their names
10. Alternate play between multiple players
