# Task for Step 01: Create a single styled card, face up

You can start by creating a square card with an image of two cherries, using the Unicode emoji character üçí. 

1. Create a Card component and send it the üçí as a prop.
2. Give the Card component a "card" className.
3. Put all your CSS inside `styles.css`.
4. Centre the image.
5. Give the card a neutral background and a border.
6. Give the card rounded corners

Emoji characters can scale to any size, so make the card fill the viewport, then alter the size of the viewport to check that the card, the border and the image all scale proportionately.
