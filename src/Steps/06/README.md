# Task for Step 05: Display multiple pairs of cards

Create a layout of 30 cards, to fit the viewport. Use the number of rows and columns that maximizes the size of the individual cards.

You can use the full list of 15 fruit and vegetable emoji characters.

```javascript
const images = [ "üçí", "üçé", "üçè", "üçê", "üçë", "üçì", "üçá", "üçà", "üçâ", "üçä", "üçã", "üçå", "üçç", "üçÖ", "üçÜ" ]
```
### Tips:
1. Find the aspect ratio of the viewport
2. Consider a square whose sides are the length of the shortest sides of the viewport
3. Calculate which proportion of the 30 cards should appear in that square
4. Find the square root of that number.
5. Round the square root up to the nearest whole number. This will tell you how many rows and columns of cards can fit into the square.
6. Divide the shortest side of the viewport by this rounded-up number. This will be the length of the side of each card.

Example: Suppose viewport is 640 pixels by 320 pixels. This gives an aspect-ratio is 2:1. This means that 15 cards must fit into each square half of the viewport. `Math.sqrt(15)` is about `3.873`, but you can't have `3.873` rows or columns: you must have an integer number. You can create `4` rows and columns of cards in each square half of the viewport (or 16 cards in one half and 14 cards in the other.) The length of the side of each card should be the length of the shortest side divided by 4: `320 / 4 = 80px`. And you will have 4 rows and 8 columns... or rather 3 rows with 8 cards and 1 row with 6 cards.

7. To create the layout, you can use one `<div>` for each row of cards, and place the column-count of cards in each row `<div>`. The last row may not contain as many cards as the other rows.

At the end of this step, you should have a responsive layout, where the cards fill the screen optimally, regardless of the aspect ratio. You should be able to click any card to turn it. There won't yet be a limit to the number of cards you can turn.


# Task for Step 04 (optional): Simulate turning the cards

Simulate turning the cards using CSS. You'll need to add a container element for each card, and use some 3D styling.

**NOTE: This step is optional. You can skip it if you like.**

It makes the project more fun to work on, but you might prefer to focus on the game logic, and simply adopt the proposed solution by moving on to the next step.

# Task for Step 03: Turn card over when clicked
*(See CHANGELOG.md for details of how Step 02 was treated.)*

Turn either card over when it is clicked.

* Display two cards face down, side-by-side or one beneath each other as before.
* Add an `onClick` event listener to the cards so that they turn over when clicked.

Tips:
1. Create an array containing two cherry emoji characters
2. Create an array containing two `false` values, indicating the initial "turned" state of the two cards
3. Use useState() to track changes to the "turned" state
4. Use Array.map() on your images array to create an array of `<Card />` components
5. Use the `index` argument of the `map` callback function to determine what value to use for `turned` for each card.
6. Remember that, for JavaScript, an *array* is an *address in your computer's RAM space* where the data in the array is stored. If you updated an array and then use a `useState` setter to tell React that you have updated the array, React will just see the same RAM address, and think nothing has changed. You need to call the `useState` setter with a *new* array (at a different RAM address), so that React will pay attention.
   ```javascript
   const [ faceDown, setFaceDown ] = useState([ false, false ])

   faceDown[0] = !faceDown[0] // the local faceDown array is updated
   setFaceDown[...faceDown]   // React sees a clone of the local array
   ```


# Task for Step 02: Create styling for the card back
*(See CHANGELOG.md for details of how Step 01 was treated.)*

Display two cards side-by-side, or one beneath the other, depending on the aspect-ratio of the browser window. The first card should be the one you created in step 01. The second should show the back of the card.

1. Display two Card components, both with a "card" className and with the üçí emoji character as a prop.
2. The first component should receive a `turned` prop with a value of `true` and be shown face-up, as before
3. The second component should receive a `turned` prop with a value of `false` and it should show the back of the card.
4. Give the card back a gradient, and the same border as the front.
5. Do not show the üçí image on the face-down card.
6. As before, put all your CSS inside `styles.css`.
7. If the page is in portrait mode, show the cards one above the other; if it is in landscape mode, show them side-by-side.

You can see a demo of the expected result [here](https://dciforks.github.io/memory/step/02). Do your best to match the styling as closely as possible. You will use the suggested styling as the starting point for the next step.

# Task for Step 01: Create a single styled card, face up

You can start by creating a square card with an image of two cherries, using the Unicode emoji character üçí. 

1. Create a Card component and send it the üçí emoji character as a prop.
2. Give the Card component a "card" className.
3. Put all your CSS inside `styles.css`.
4. Centre the image.
5. Give the card a neutral background and a border.
6. Give the card rounded corners

Emoji characters can scale to any size, so make the card fill the viewport, then alter the size of the viewport to check that the card, the border and the image all scale proportionately.

You can see a demo of the expected result [here](https://dciforks.github.io/memory/step/01). Do your best to match the styling as closely as possible. You will use the suggested styling as the starting point for the next step.


# Building a Memory game in React

This repo contains a multi-step assignment that guides you as you build a Memory game using React.

The branches are named step01, step02 and so on. Each branch contains a README.md (like this one) with a simple task for you to complete. The next branch in numerical order contains a solution for the previous task, plus a new task.

You can find a demo of the completed game [here](https://dciforks.github.io/memory). You can use the hamburger menu on this page to see side-by-side each of the tasks and the expected result of that completed task.‚óä

Here's an overview of the steps:

1. Create a single styled card, face up
2. Create the styling for the back of the card
3. Use CSS classes to flip the card
4. Create a responsive layout of multiple cards
5. Use React.useReducer to ensure that a maximum of two cards can be flipped at a time
6. Detect matching pairs of cards
7. Use custom images
8. Select the number of pairs to use for a game
9. Allow players to enter their names
10. Alternate play between multiple players
11. Show the winner
